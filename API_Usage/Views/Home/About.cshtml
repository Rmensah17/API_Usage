        This is an extension of the IEX Trading application. As a group we thought the current IEX Trading was limited in some form of functionalities. Our Main goal is to provide a comprehensive platfrom through which users are able to compare different stocks. 
        The generated platform allow them to choose the stocks and compare them either through daily or annual equities or by the mean of financial attributes of the stocks or real time quotes. In addition to that,
        we are adding five more API end points to pull stock data including the below:
        <ul>
            <li>
                /stock/aapl/quote: This gives us the quota data
            </li>
            <li>
                /stock/aapl/financials: Pulls income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow data from the four most recent reported quarters.
            </li>
            <li>
                /stock/aapl/chart/1y: Historically adjusted market-wide data
            </li>
            <li>
                /stock/aapl/chart/1d: Performed a batch request for two symbols
            </li>
            <li>
                /stock/aapl/chart: IEX-only data by minute //this is company not chart and we should let them know we have added more properties to the existing classes
            </li>

        </ul>

        Our application focused mostly on the Stock data that IEXTrading is proving through their end point.
        Among the five, all of them had lots of fields avaialable to choose from, but for simplicity we only pulled the fields that we needed for enhancing the application.

        We created five database tables to hold these data These table definitions can be seen in the Model classes where we provided data dictionary for all the tables and feilds.
        The new classes added are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                AllEquities
            </li>
            <li>
                EQComparison
            </li>
            <li>
                EF_Model
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        DailyEquity
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Financial
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Quota

                    </li>

                </ul>
            <li>
                Companies: We extended the existing table by adding additional fields that we used in our application
            </li>
            <li>
                Equities: We extended the existing table by adding additional fields that we used in our application
            </li>
            </li>
        </ul>
