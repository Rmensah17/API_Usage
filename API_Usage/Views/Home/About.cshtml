        This is an extension of the IEX Trading application. As a group we thought the current IEX Trading was limited in some form of functionalities. In addition to that,
        we are adding five more API end points to pull stock data including the below:
        <ul>
            <li>
                /stock/aapl/quote: This gives us the quota data
            </li>
            <li>
                /stock/aapl/financials: Pulls income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow data from the four most recent reported quarters.
            </li>
            <li>
                /stock/aapl/chart/1y: Historically adjusted market-wide data
            </li>
            <li>
                /stock/aapl/chart/1d: Performed a batch request for two symbols
            </li>
            <li>
                /stock/aapl/chart: IEX-only data by minute
            </li>

        </ul>

        Our application focused mostly on the Stock data that IEXTrading is proving through their end point.
        Among the five, all of them had lots of fields avaialable to choose from, but for simplicity we only pulled the fields that we needed for enhancing the application.

        We created five database tables to hold these data These table definitions can be seen in the Model classes where we provided data dictionary for all the tables and feilds.
        The new classes added are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                AllEquities
            </li>
            <li>
                EQComparison
            </li>
            <li>
                EF_Model
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        DailyEquity
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Financial
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Quota>

                    </li>

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
